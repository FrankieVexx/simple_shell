.SH NAME
.B Simple shell
- a simple command interpreter

.SH SYNOPSIS
command[-o option_name][command_file[argument ...]]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B simple_shell
command line interpreter based on the first Unix shell 'sh',
created by Ken Thompson in 1971.
simple_shell is intentionally minimalistic and contains functionality for only
the most basic shell tasks - accepting input, parsing the input into a command
and its arguments, and executing that input. Error checking is simple
and follows Bash conventions.
.SH INVOCATION

if the strd input of the shell is connected to a term
shell is considered interactive
command line arguments besides the options have been specified,
then the shell treats the first argument as
the name of a file from which to read commands(a shell script),
and the remaining arguments are set as the posi‚Äê
tional parameters of the shell($1, $2, etc)
Otherwise, the shell reads commands from its standard input.
